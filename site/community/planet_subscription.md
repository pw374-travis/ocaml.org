# OCaml Planet Subscription

## Guidelines

Feeds agregated by the [OCaml Planet](planet.html) are of
two types: people and institutional.

People feeds are for individual working in the field of OCaml.  Talking
about OCaml in every entry is not mandatory.  On the contrary, this is
an occasion to extend the field.  However, entries must respect the
terms of use and the philosophy of `ocaml.org`. Posts should avoid
too commercial oriented content. If you own a personnal blog that
contains at the same time a lot of posts about other topics, we will
be thankful that you provide us with a filtered content (e.g., using a
tag).

Institutional are feeds that only handle OCaml information.  The best
way to define what they are is by giving some examples:

- NEWS of an ocaml project (release of OCaml, release of PXP...)
- [Caml Weekly News](http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/index.html)
- ...

## How to subscribe your feed

Due to spam, the `ocaml.org` team has disabled automatic planet
subscription. You can still ask to be added to the planet by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues) with
the title "Add URL to planet".

You need to provide three informations in your issue:

- A name for the feed, this can be your name if the feed is about a
  person (e.g. "Sylvain Le Gall"), or the name of the official OCaml
  information channel (e.g. "Caml Weekly News")

- An URL for downloading the feed, this URL must give access to the
  RSS feed itself

- Wether this feed is about a person (People) or an official OCaml
  information channel (Institutional). See the above guidelines
  concerning subscription for this two differents kind of feeds.

Once you have provided every information, your subscription will be
reviewed by an administrator and put online. If you want to have a
good chance to join the feed there must be at least one post about
OCaml in the most recent entries.

## Feedburner

Unfortunately, we don't know how to use feeds using feedburner
proxy. It redirects our request and remove the specific search for
OCaml contents. For examples, we cannot ask only posts that has the
"ocaml" tags using feedburner.

This make your day to day blog content mixed with pure OCaml content.
